 
 # 🔐 **Network Access Control (NAC) System**
A secure and intelligent system designed to **enforce access control policies** within a network environment by validating users and devices before granting access.

 📌 Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a Network Access Control (NAC) system that strengthens internal network security by ensuring only authenticated and compliant devices/users are allowed to connect. This is achieved by enforcing dynamic policies using authentication protocols and network-level controls.

 📖 Overview
Network security is critical in preventing unauthorized access and mitigating internal threats. This NAC system integrates technologies such as 802.1X authentication, RADIUS, VLAN segmentation, and Linux iptables to provide a robust solution for managing device access at the edge of the network.

The system performs device identification and user validation, and applies network access rules based on:

- Device MAC addresses
- Authentication credentials
- Device fingerprinting
- Network compliance checks

With scripting in Python and Bash, the system automates key control mechanisms and interacts with underlying Linux networking components to control access dynamically.

 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ 802.1X-based port authentication  
- ✅ RADIUS server integration for user validation  
- ✅ MAC address filtering and spoof detection  
- ✅ Device fingerprinting for enhanced identification  
- ✅ Dynamic VLAN assignment based on user/device profile  
- ✅ Access logging and alerting mechanisms  
- ✅ Firewall rules and packet filtering with `iptables`  


 🧠 Skills Utilized
- Authentication Protocols: 802.1X, RADIUS
- Network Concepts: VLANs, Switching, Layer 2/3 access control
- Linux Networking: iptables, interfaces, routing
- Scripting: Python and Bash automation
- Security Techniques: MAC filtering, device fingerprinting

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- `FreeRADIUS`
- `hostapd` (for access point simulation)
- `iptables` / `nftables`
- `Python 3.x`
- `Bash scripting`
- `Wireshark` / `tcpdump` (for packet inspection)

### 🧪 Use Cases
- Corporate LAN access control
- University campus networks
- IoT device access enforcement
- Public Wi-Fi network segmentation
